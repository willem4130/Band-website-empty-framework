**Authentication**: [None, simple login, OAuth, enterprise SSO, API keys, etc.]
**Testing Strategy**: [Unit tests required, integration tests, E2E tests, manual testing only]
**Documentation Needed**: [API docs, user guide, developer docs, inline comments]

## üì¶ Package & Library Recommendations
*[Instructions for Claude: When filling out this template, analyze the project's tech stack, type, complexity, and feature requirements above. Research and recommend specific packages/libraries that solve common problems rather than building custom solutions. Consider all development aspects: UI, backend, database, testing, deployment, security, performance, developer tools, etc. Prioritize battle-tested, well-maintained packages over custom implementation. Adapt recommendations to the specific language/framework ecosystem. Replace this instruction text with your analysis and specific package recommendations tailored to this project.]*

**Recommended Packages for This Project**:
```
[Create custom package recommendations here based on the specific project requirements above]
```

**Package Selection Reasoning**: [Explain why these packages fit this specific project's needs, tech stack, and complexity level]

**Implementation Priority**: [Which packages to set up first vs later in development]

## üìÅ Project Structure Recommendation
*[Instructions for Claude: When filling out this template, analyze the project's tech stack, size, complexity, and team size above. Then create a tailored folder structure recommendation that fits this specific project. Consider: frontend/backend split, monolith vs microservices, testing needs, deployment requirements, and team experience level. Replace this instruction text with your analysis and specific structure recommendation.]*

**Recommended Structure for This Project**:
```
[Create custom structure here based on the specific project requirements above]
```

**Structure Reasoning**: [Explain why this structure fits this specific project - consider the tech stack, team size, complexity, and features listed above]

**Key Organizational Principles for This Project**: 
- [List 3-4 specific principles that apply to this project type/size]

**Migration Notes** (if improving existing project): [If this is a messy existing project, provide specific steps to move toward the recommended structure]

## How to Use This File

1. **Fill out every section** - the more detail you provide, the better tasks will be sequenced
2. **Be specific** - "User can log in" is vague, "User can log in with email/password, get JWT token, handle forgot password" is actionable  
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Priority 1 features should be the absolute minimum viable product
4. **Flag unknowns** - If you're unsure about an API or technology, mark it as "Unknown" complexity
5. **Reference files clearly** - Put design files in `./screenshots/` or `./design/` and reference them exactly
6. **Think dependencies** - Features that depend on others should be clearly described

After completing this file, run `/new-project` to generate optimized task sequences!
